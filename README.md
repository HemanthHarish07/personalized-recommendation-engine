# Personalized Recommendation Engine

## Problem Statement
Online platforms must recommend relevant items to users based on their past interactions.
Without personalization, users are shown generic or popular items, leading to poor engagement
and reduced user satisfaction.

This project builds a personalized recommendation system that suggests items to users
based on historical user–item interaction data.

## Why Recommendation Systems Matter
Recommendation systems are a core component of modern digital platforms such as e-commerce
websites and content platforms. Effective recommendations improve user engagement, retention,
and overall business value.

This project focuses on building and evaluating classical collaborative filtering approaches
used in real-world systems.

## Project Scope
The system uses implicit or explicit user–item interactions to generate top-N personalized
recommendations. The project emphasizes:
- Baseline comparison
- Model interpretability
- Reproducibility
- Clear evaluation

Deep learning methods are intentionally excluded to focus on core recommender system concepts.
